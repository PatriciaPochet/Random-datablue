### Random-groups

Our trainer challenged us to write a program to create random working groups for dojos, exercises or projects for our class. 

I decided to give it a try and wrote a program able to create working groups accordingly to the number of groups wished. 

Everything is automated for our class:
- all the students are registered to not have to enter the names each time we use the program
- the program identifies if it can create equal groups or not
- if the groups are equal, it informs us of the number of students per group and then print the groups formed
- if the groups are not equal, it informs us of the number of groups with the maximum nomber of students required and the number of groups with the minimum number of students needed and then print the groups constituted
